# Sessa Research Group - Drug Safety
Welcome to the GitHub organization for the Sessa Research Group at the University of Copenhagen. We are a multidisciplinary team dedicated to advancing drug safety research through cutting-edge methods in data science, epidemiology, and artificial intelligence.

## 🧬 About the Group
At the intersection of pharmaceutical science and applied data science, our group pioneers the use of large-scale biomedical datasets to address complex public health challenges. We develop and implement intelligent automation strategies, with a strong focus on pharmacovigilance and pharmacoepidemiology, working closely with regulatory bodies and industry partners.

Our mission is to enhance the safety and effectiveness of medical treatments by transforming the way drug safety data is analyzed, interpreted, and acted upon.

### 🔍 Research Areas
- 🧪 **Applied Precision Medicine (Individualised Therapeutics):** Leveraging omics-driven insights to tailor treatment decisions based on patient-specific biological data.
- 🛡️ **Pre-symptomatic Care (Precision Prevention):** Developing data-driven methods to identify health risks in large populations before clinical symptoms emerge.
- 🤖 **AI-Driven Pharmacovigilance:** Harnessing artificial intelligence to modernize adverse event detection, automate signal detection, and improve decision support systems.
- 📊 **AI-Driven Pharmacoepidemiology:** Applying machine learning to real-world data to advance our understanding of medication use, outcomes, and safety at scale.

## 📁 Repository Structure
Our GitHub organization hosts multiple repositories aligned with the group’s research focus. Repositories follow a consistent structure to promote collaboration and reproducibility:
```bash
📂
├── server_connection/          # Instructions for server access and folder setup
└── README.md                   # This file
